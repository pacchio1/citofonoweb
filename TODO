This project runs nicely, but has still some rough edges:
- it needs good docs
- it needs a gui to edit acls (the "phpliteadmin" interface is just a workaround)
- the daemon should be coded in C, to allow users to remove the web interface and all the php stuff
- the paths need some tuning: installing in /var/www is wrong in a non-Debian setup, conf should be in /etc/
